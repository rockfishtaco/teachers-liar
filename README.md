# teachers-liar
a POV project to solve teacher shortage with a bridge to modify student relationships

This is a project to drive subscription rates between students by creating a signal based communication network to showcase day to day reality with a go pro and osb based visual
tutorial layer combined with a java script development front end with the mechanics of modern technical applications.

front end html injected static website with minimal library use based on content retrival and distribution among social networks.
natural language model built and distributed for academic institutions globally. It would be great to limit calls and reduce latency by complete server side rendered blocks of data that could build on neural networks.
